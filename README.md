# handwritten-digit-detection

This software implements from scratch a simple feed-forward neural network 
using SGD and fully connected layers. The network is used to train on the MNIST 
database.

This code was made using the online book "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" 
written by Michael Nielsen. It can be found at 
http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html.

Run the following the initiate the training.
```bash
cd src
./main.py
```
